  The Personal Project is a self directed project concerning the feasability of using AI Generated Art in the Board Game design space. Using the art from Mysterium, an art based deduction board game, as weighted training data for the WOMBO AI diffusion model, 10 images were generated using randomized prompts and styles. A survey was deployed asking forum members of Board Game Geek (a popular online board game database) to rate the images in terms of usability in Mysterium. Results were recorded and presented at a University of Chicago data science convention.
